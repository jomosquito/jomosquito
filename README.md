# Hi, I'm Joseph Mascardo

I am a **Computer Science graduate from the University of Houston** with a specialization in **cybersecurity**, graduating in December 2025.

I currently work as a **System Support Analyst at DCCM**, an engineering consulting firm in Houston, where I was recently named an **AI lead**. I implemented Azure AI Document Intelligence with custom extraction models and develop enterprise applications serving 100+ employees.

I enjoy solving complex problems through software development and exploring how AI can transform business operations. My passions include full-stack development, AI/ML implementation, and building tools that make real-world impact.

My experience includes building **multi-tenant web applications**, **GIS platforms**, and **NLP-powered search systems**. I focus on creating scalable solutions using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and Azure.

## 📌 Featured Projects

### Amazon Review Search Engine `NLP` `DEC 2025`
An NLP-powered search engine that implements boolean retrieval (AND, OR, NOT operators) as a baseline, then layers sentiment lexicon classification using positive/negative word dictionaries to filter results by opinion polarity. The multi-stage pipeline performs sentence-level aspect-opinion extraction to ensure query terms co-occur within the same sentence, combined with rating correlation to validate sentiment alignment. This approach significantly improved search precision over standard keyword matching methods.

🔧 **Technologies Used:** Python, NLTK, Pandas, Regular Expressions

### GIS Municipal Utility Management Platform `FULL-STACK` `2025-PRESENT`
A multi-tenant GIS platform serving 12+ Texas utility districts with interactive Google Maps integration for geospatial visualization of water, sewer, and storm infrastructure. Features include dynamic GeoJSON layer management, valve isolation analysis for emergency response enabling field crews to identify affected customers during water main breaks, role-based access control with Auth0 authentication, and real-time feature search across large geospatial datasets. The backend uses Node.js/Express with Azure Blob Storage for geospatial data, while the frontend is built with React/TypeScript.

🔧 **Technologies Used:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Azure, Google Maps API, Auth0, GitHub Actions

### Client Event Management Platform `FULL-STACK` `FEB 2026`
A full-stack application featuring Excel bulk import with a 3-stage data processing workflow (parse, duplicate detection, conflict resolution) that handles large datasets efficiently. Implements Auth0 JWT authentication for secure access, Prisma ORM for type-safe database queries with multi-environment support (development, staging, production), and PostgreSQL for relational data storage. The frontend uses React with Material UI components and provides full CRUD operations. Deployed on Azure with CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.

🔧 **Technologies Used:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, Auth0, PostgreSQL, Azure, GitHub Actions

### CoogMusic `TEAM PROJECT` `FEB 2025-MAY 2025`
A Node.js-based music streaming platform developed by a team of five for a university class project. It allows UH students and alumni to upload, share, and stream original music. Users can upload songs with metadata, create playlists, and stream tracks through a clean, interactive UI. The backend uses Azure MySQL for structured data storage and Azure Blob Storage for media file handling, while the frontend is built with React and styled using CSS for a responsive experience.

🔧 **Technologies Used:** Node.js, JavaScript, React, CSS, Azure, MySQL
