# Hi, I'm Joseph Mascardo

I am a **Computer Science graduate from the University of Houston** with a specialization in **cybersecurity**, graduating in December 2025.

I currently work as a **System Support Analyst at DCCM**, an engineering consulting firm in Houston, where I was recently named an **AI lead**. I implemented Azure AI Document Intelligence with custom extraction models and develop enterprise applications serving 100+ employees.

I enjoy solving complex problems through software development and exploring how AI can transform business operations. My passions include full-stack development, AI/ML implementation, and building tools that make real-world impact.

My experience includes building **multi-tenant web applications**, **GIS platforms**, and **NLP-powered search systems**. I focus on creating scalable solutions using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and Azure.
